# NEO-app
This project was made with the help of
[Vite.js](https://vitejs.dev/) and
[NASA.api](https://api.nasa.gov/)

Main function of the NEO web application is to track NEO (Near Earth Objects) and collect data from the first day of the month till the current day. Application display data every 5 seconds as a card for each day.
Inside app, you can see cards with asteroids/per day information. There you can find the maximum diameter of the most enormous asteroid on this day, the distance between Earth and the closest object, and velocity of the fastest object.
Each card contains a count of potentially hazardous for collision with Earth NEOs. The application will mark 2 most hazardous days on your screen with a red color.
